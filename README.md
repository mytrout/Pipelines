# Pipelines

## Introduction
Provides a non-HTTP pipeline similar to the ASP.NET Core request pipeline.

MyTrout.Pipelines targets [.NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)

If three steps named M1, M2, and M3 were added to the Pipeline, here is the execution path for the code.

The Pipeline automatically adds the NoOpStep as the last step in the Pipeline.
